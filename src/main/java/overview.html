This document is for the JDBC implementation of Phoenix, targeting those who are interested in extending the level of SQL support.
For users of Phoenix, the programmatic API is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/package-summary.html">JDBC</a>.
For example, the following snippet demonstrates how to query a table:

<pre>
        Properties props = new Properties();
        // Ensure the driver is on classpath
        // Connect through Phoenix to the zookeeper quorum with a host name of myServer
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:phoenix:myServer", props);
        try {
            PreparedStatement statement = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT count(1) FROM product_metrics WHERE organization_id=?");
            statement.setString(1, orgId);
            ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
            if (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println("Row count of orgId='" + orgId + "' is " + rs.getLong(1));
            }
        } finally {
            conn.close();
        }
</pre>
