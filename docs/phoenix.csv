"Commands","SELECT","
SELECT selectExpression [,...] FROM tableExpression [ WHERE expression ]
[ GROUP BY expression [,...] ] [ HAVING expression ]
[ ORDER BY order [,...] ]
[ LIMIT {bindParameter | number} ]
","
Selects data from a table.
GROUP BY groups the the result by the given expression(s).
HAVING filter rows after grouping.
ORDER BY sorts the result by the given column(s) or expression(s) and is only allowed for aggregate
queries or queries with a LIMIT clause.
LIMIT limits the number of rows returned by the query with no limit applied if specified as null or
less than zero. The LIMIT clause is executed prior to the ORDER BY clause, so rows which sort above
the returned rows may be clipped and subsequently not returned.
Only single tables are currently supported - joins are currently not supported.

"Commands","UPSERT VALUES","
UPSERT INTO tableName [( columnName [,...] )] VALUES ( constantTerm [,...] )
","
Inserts if not present and updates otherwise the value in the table. The list of
columns is optional and if not present, the values will map to the column in the
order they are declared in the schema. The values must evaluate to constants.

","
UPSERT INTO TEST VALUES('foo','bar',3);
UPSERT INTO TEST(NAME,ID) VALUES('foo',123);
"
"Commands","UPSERT SELECT","
UPSERT INTO tableName [( columnName [,...] )] select
","
Inserts if not present and updates otherwise rows in the table based on the
results of running another query. The values are set based on their matching
position between the source and target tables. The list of columns is optional
and if not present will map to the column in the order they are declared in the
schema. If auto commit is on, and both a) the target
table matches the source table, and b) the select performs no aggregation, then the population of the target table will
be done completely on the server-side (with constraint violations logged, but otherwise ignored). Otherwise, data is
buffered on the client and, if auto commit is on, committed in row batches as specified by the UpsertBatchSize
connection property (or the phoenix.mutate.upsertBatchSize HBase config property which defaults to 10000 rows)

"Commands","DELETE","
DELETE FROM tableName [ WHERE expression ]
","
Deletes the rows selected by the where clause. If auto commit is on, the
deletion is performed completely server-side.

DELETE FROM TEST;
DELETE FROM TEST WHERE ID=123;
DELETE FROM TEST WHERE NAME LIKE 'foo%';
"

"Commands","CREATE","
CREATE { TABLE | VIEW } [IF NOT EXISTS] tableName
( column [,...] [constraint] )
[tableOptions] [ SPLIT ON ( splitPoint [,...] ) ]
","
Creates a new table or view. For the creation of a table, the HBase table and any column families referenced are created
if they don't already exist (using uppercase names unless they are double quoted in which case they are case sensitive).
Column families outside of the ones listed are not affected.
At create time, an empty key value is added to the first column family of any existing rows. Upserts will also add this empty key value. This
is done to improve query performance by having a key value column we can guarantee always being there (minimizing the amount of data that
must be projected). Alternately, if a view is
created, the HBase table and column families must already exist. No empty key value is added to existing rows and no
data mutations are allowed - the view is read-only. Query performance for a view will not be as good as performance for
a table. For a table only, HBase table and column configuration options may
be passed through as key/value pairs to setup the HBase table as needed.

"

"Commands","DROP","
DROP {TABLE | VIEW} [IF EXISTS] tableName
","
Drops a table or view. When dropping a table, the data in the table is deleted. For a view, on the other hand, the data
is not affected. Note that the schema is versioned, such that snapshot queries connecting at an earlier time stamp may
still query against the dropped table, as the HBase table itself is not deleted.

DROP TABLE my_schema.my_table
DROP VIEW my_view
"

"Commands","ALTER TABLE","
ALTER TABLE tableName { { ADD [IF NOT EXISTS] column [options] } | { DROP COLUMN [IF EXISTS] [ familyName. ] columnName } }
","
Adds or removes a column from an existing table or view. When a column is dropped from a table, the data in
that column is deleted as well. PK columns may not be dropped, and only nullable PK columns may be added. For a view,
the data is not affected when a column is dropped. Note that creating or dropping columns
only affects subsequent queries and data modifications. Snapshot queries that are connected at an earlier timestamp
will still use the prior schema that was in place when the data was written.
