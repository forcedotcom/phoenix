","
Selects data from a table.
DISTINCT filters out duplicate results while ALL, the default, includes all results.
FROM identifies the table being queried (single table only currently - no joins or derived tables yet).
Dynamic columns not declared at create time may be defined in parenthesis after the table name and then
used in the query.
GROUP BY groups the the result by the given expression(s).
HAVING filter rows after grouping.
ORDER BY sorts the result by the given column(s) or expression(s) and is only allowed for aggregate
queries or queries with a LIMIT clause.
LIMIT limits the number of rows returned by the query with no limit applied if specified as null or
less than zero. The LIMIT clause is executed after the ORDER BY clause to support TopN type queries.
An optional hint overrides the default query plan.

columns is optional and if not present, the values will map to the column in the
order they are declared in the schema. The values must evaluate to constants.

Inserts if not present and updates otherwise rows in the table based on the
results of running another query. The values are set based on their matching
position between the source and target tables. The list of columns is optional
and if not present will map to the column in the order they are declared in the
schema. If auto commit is on, and both a) the target
table matches the source table, and b) the select performs no aggregation, then the population of the target table will
be done completely on the server-side (with constraint violations logged, but otherwise ignored). Otherwise, data is
buffered on the client and, if auto commit is on, committed in row batches as specified by the UpsertBatchSize
connection property (or the phoenix.mutate.upsertBatchSize HBase config property which defaults to 10000 rows)

"Commands","CREATE","
CREATE { TABLE | VIEW } [IF NOT EXISTS] tableRef
( columnDef [,...] [constraint] )
[tableOptions] [ SPLIT ON ( splitPoint [,...] ) ]
","
Creates a new table or view. For the creation of a table, the HBase table and any column families referenced are created
if they don't already exist (using uppercase names unless they are double quoted in which case they are case sensitive).
Column families outside of the ones listed are not affected.
At create time, an empty key value is added to the first column family of any existing rows. Upserts will also add this empty key value. This
is done to improve query performance by having a key value column we can guarantee always being there (minimizing the amount of data that
must be projected). Alternately, if a view is
created, the HBase table and column families must already exist. No empty key value is added to existing rows and no
data mutations are allowed - the view is read-only. Query performance for a view will not be as good as performance for
a table. For a table only, HBase table and column configuration options may
be passed through as key/value pairs to setup the HBase table as needed.

"Commands","DROP","
DROP {TABLE | VIEW} [IF EXISTS] tableRef
","
Drops a table or view. When dropping a table, the data in the table is deleted. For a view, on the other hand, the data
is not affected. Note that the schema is versioned, such that snapshot queries connecting at an earlier time stamp may
still query against the dropped table, as the HBase table itself is not deleted.

DROP TABLE my_schema.my_table

"

"Commands","ALTER TABLE","
ALTER TABLE tableRef { { ADD [IF NOT EXISTS] columnDef [options] } | { DROP COLUMN [IF EXISTS] columnRef } }
","
Adds or removes a column from an existing table or view. When a column is dropped from a table, the data in
that column is deleted as well. PK columns may not be dropped, and only nullable PK columns may be added. For a view,
the data is not affected when a column is dropped. Note that creating or dropping columns
only affects subsequent queries and data modifications. Snapshot queries that are connected at an earlier timestamp
will still use the prior schema that was in place when the data was written.

CREATE INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] indexName

","
Creates a new secondary index on a table. Currently indexes may only be added to tables that are declared as having
immutable rows (i.e. by specifying the IMMUTABLE_ROWS=true property when the table is created). Immutable rows are
expected to be inserted once in their entirety and then never updated. This limitation will be removed once incremental
index maintenance has been implemented. The current implementation inserts the index rows when the data row is inserted.

"Commands","DROP INDEX","
DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] indexName ON tableRef
","
Drops an index from a table. When dropping an index, the data in the index is deleted. Note that since metadata is versioned,
snapshot queries connecting at an earlier time stamp may still use the index, as the HBase table backing the index is not deleted.

","

"Commands","ALTER INDEX","

Disables or enables an index. An index that is disabled will not be used at query time. This has no affect on index maintenance -
an index that is disabled will continue to be maintained.

"Other Grammar","Constraint","
CONSTRAINT constraintName PRIMARY KEY (columnName [ASC | DESC] [,...])
","
Defines a multi-part primary key constraint. Each column may be declared to be
sorted in ascending or descending ordering. The default is ascending.

","
CONSTRAINT my_pk PRIMARY KEY (host,created_date)
CONSTRAINT my_pk PRIMARY KEY (host ASC,created_date DESC)
"

"Other Grammar","Options","
{ [familyName .] name= {value | bindParameter}} [,...]
","
Sets an option on an HBase table or column by modifying the respective HBase metadata.
The option applies to the named family or if omitted to all families if the name
references an HColumnDescriptor property. Otherwise, the option applies to the
HTableDescriptor.

One built-in option is SALT_BUCKETS. This option causes an extra byte to be transparently
prepended to every row key to ensure an even distribution of write load across all
your region servers. This is useful when your row key is always monotonically increasing
causing hot spotting on a single region server. The byte is determined by hashing the row
key and modding it with the SALT_BUCKETS value. The value may be from 1 to 256. If not
split points are defined for the table, it will automatically be pre-split at each possible
salt bucket value. For an excellent write-up of this technique, see
http://blog.sematext.com/2012/04/09/hbasewd-avoid-regionserver-hotspotting-despite-writing-records-with-sequential-keys/

Another built-in options is IMMUTABLE_ROWS. Only tables with immutable rows are allowed to have indexes.
Immutable rows are expected to be inserted once in their entirety and then never updated. This limitation will be removed
once incremental index maintenance has been implemented. The current implementation inserts the index rows when the data
row is inserted.

"

"Other Grammar","Hint","
name [,...]
","
Advanced features that overrides default query processing behavior. The
three supported hints are 1) SKIP_SCAN to force a skip scan to be performed on the query when
it otherwise would not. This option may improve performance if a query does
not include the leading primary key column, but does include other, very
selective primary key columns. 2) RANGE_SCAN to force a range scan to be
performed on the query. This option may improve performance if a query
filters on a range for non selective leading primary key column along
with other primary key columns 3) NO_INTRA_REGION_PARALLELIZATION to prevent the
spawning of multiple threads to process data within a single region. This
option is useful when the overall data set being queries is known to be
small.

Returns a substring of a string starting at the one-based position.
If zero is used, the position is zero-based. If the start index is
negative, then the start index is relative to the end of the string.
The length is optional and if not supplied, the rest of the string
will be returned.

numbers. This method returns a string.
","
TO_CHAR(myDate, '2001-02-03 04:05:06')
TO_CHAR(myDecimal, '#,##0.###')
"

"Functions (Time and Date)","TO_DATE","
TO_DATE( stringTerm [, formatString] )
","
Parses a string and returns a date.
The most important format characters are:
y year, M month, d day, H hour, m minute, s second.
The default format string is ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"".
