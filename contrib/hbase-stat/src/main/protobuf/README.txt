These are the protobuf definition files used by hbase-stat. The produced java
classes are generated into src/main/java/com/salesforce/hbase/protobuf/generated
and then checked in.  The reasoning is that they change infrequently.

To regnerate the classes after making definition file changes, ensure first that
the protobuf protoc tool is in your $PATH (You may need to download it and build
it first; its part of the protobuf package obtainable from here: 
http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list).  Then run the following from 
contrib/hbase-stat (You should be able to just copy and paste the below into a 
terminal and hit return -- the protoc compiler runs fast):

  UNIX_PROTO_DIR=src/main/protobuf
  JAVA_DIR=src/main/java/
  mkdir -p $JAVA_DIR 2> /dev/null
  if which cygpath 2> /dev/null; then
    PROTO_DIR=`cygpath --windows $UNIX_PROTO_DIR`
    JAVA_DIR=`cygpath --windows $JAVA_DIR`
  else
    PROTO_DIR=$UNIX_PROTO_DIR
  fi
  for PROTO_FILE in $UNIX_PROTO_DIR/*.proto
  do
    protoc -I$PROTO_DIR --java_out=$JAVA_DIR $PROTO_FILE
  done

After you've done the above, check it in.
