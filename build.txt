# Building Phoenix
================

Phoenix uses Maven (3.X) to build all its necessary resources. 

## Building from source
=======================

	$ mvn process-sources

2. To build the jars
	$ mvn package
and optionally, to just skip all the tests and build the jars:
	$ mvn package -DskipTests

Note: javadocs are generated in target/apidocs

	$ mvn clean test
