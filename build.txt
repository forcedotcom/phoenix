# Building Phoenix
================

Phoenix uses Maven (3.X) to build all its necessary resources.

## Building from source
=======================

1. To re-generate the antrl based files:
	$ mvn generate-sources

2. To build the jars
	$ mvn package
and optionally, to just skip all the tests and build the jars:
	$ mvn package -DskipTests

3. 

## Importing into eclipse
=========================

Use the m2e eclipse plugin and do Import->Maven Project and just pick the root 'phoenix' directory.

## Running the tests
====================

	$ mvn clean test
